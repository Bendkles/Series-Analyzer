# Series-Analyzer
Build a simple program in Bash Scripting that can display some statistical properties of a positive numbers series.

● The program should work with a textual UI
● The first operation is the input of the series (validate at least 3 positive numbers !). There are two possibilities:
  a. The series was enetred using external argument through the command line.
  b. If there was no external argument, (or wrong input ) the user will be asked to input a series.

● After setting the series, the program will work with a menu:
  a. Input a Series. (Replace the current series)
  b. Display the series in the order it was entered.
  c. Display the series in sorted order (from low to high).
  d. Display the Max value of the series.
  e. Display the Min value of the series.
  f. Display the Average of the series.
  g. Display the Number of elements in the series.
  h. Display the Sum of the series.
  i. Exit.
● After choosing a correct option in the menu (validate !) a. After input of the menu option, the calculation should be done. b. The answer should be displayed. c. The menu should be displayed once again - until Exit option is chosen.

Implementation:
● You have to Validate the input (number). 
● Implement and use function for each menu option, common tasks in the code Etc. 
● Implement as many auxiliary functions as you can.(input,input validation, menu Etc. ) 
● You need to follow the rules of modular programming (scoping - local/global, function modularity, code reuse, interfaces between functions - args/returned value Etc.)
